The optimal performance of DC motors is intrinsically linked to the precision of their mathematical models and the effectiveness of their controllers. However, the limited availability of motor characteristic information poses significant challenges to achieving accurate modeling and robust control. This paper introduces a novel approach employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to estimate critical DC motor parameters by defining practical constraints that simplify the estimation process. A mathematical model is established for optimal parameter estimation, and two advanced learning algorithms are proposed to train the ANN efficiently. The algorithms’ performance is thoroughly analyzed using metrics such as mean squared error, epoch count, and execution time, ensuring the reliability of dynamic priority arbitration and data integrity. The ANN-based estimator successfully predicts electro-mechanical and electrical characteristics such as back-EMF, moment of inertia, viscous friction coefficient, armature inductance, and armature resistance. Compared to conventional methods that are often resource-intensive and time-consuming, the proposed solution offers superior accuracy, significantly reduced estimation time, and lower computational costs. The simulation results validate the proposed ANN’s effectiveness in diverse real-world operating conditions, making it a powerful tool for enhancing DC motor performance with practical applications in industrial automation and control systems.
